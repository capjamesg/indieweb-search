          <h1>About IndieWeb Search</h1>
          <p>Finding a blog post written by someone on the web is hard, especially if the author is new to publishing on the web and does not have much of an audience.</p>
          <p>Large search engines like Google and Bing have democratized access to information but they were not designed to help you find smaller, niche sites who may not think about SEO.</p>
          <p>This search engine lets you surf the IndieWeb, a community of people who own and make their own websites.</p>
          <p>The IndieWeb search engine is a work in progress. The source code is available on GitHub for those who want to contribute. We are particularly interested in improving our crawl efficiency and search results but if you see any opportunities for improvement we want to know about it.</p>
          <p>Pages in this search engine are indexed using a crawler with the user agent "indieweb-search". The crawler obeys robots.txt directives so you can block our crawler from looking at certain pages on your site (or your whole site) if you would like.</p>
          <p>The crawler behind this search engine only crawls 1,000 pages maximum per URL. This ensures that we can index content from a vast range of sources.</p>
          <p>We hope you enjoy the IndieWeb search engine!</p>
          <h2>How can I ask you to index my site?</h2>
          <p>We are not currently accepting individual requests to index sites outwith the IndieWeb community.</p>
          <p>If you are a member of the community, add your domain name as an issue in the project GitHub repository and we may add you to our crawl list.</p>
